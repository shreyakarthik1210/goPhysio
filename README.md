The project I built for the 2023 HackSMU hackathon which won 1st.

Technology: Website was hosted on Google VM and built with Python Flask. Data from application was stored in MySQL Database and a k-means clustering analysis was performed using Python. The application itself was built with Unreal. 

Idea: Utilize VR to perform range of motion and rehabilitation exercises assigned by a doctor.
